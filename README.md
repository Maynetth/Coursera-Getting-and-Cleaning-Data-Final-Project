# Coursera-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Final-Project
This is repository for the final project for the getting and cleaning data course

The project is an evaluation of this data set: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Relvant Files:
CodeBook.md is a code book that details all the relevant variables, data, and transfromations done to tidy the data.
run_analysis.R is the script used to prepare the data and tidy it up for presentation. It's based on the 5 instructions detailed in the project description
- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each   variable for each activity and each subject.
tidy_dataset.txt is the final data set that has been cleaned and structured.
